The goal for this project is to design a low cost and lightweight smart chess board that can help players learn how to play chess. The smart chess board will also be compact and portable so that the board can be carried around while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic design. The main learning objective for this project is to understand and implement an embedded system with various sensors and to write software to incorporate all the hardware together. 

A variety of features will be included in the design of the board. The smart chess board will run on a rechargeable battery and have an efficient battery life to last multiple games. A mode selector will be implemented so that the user can choose to play against an AI or another human player. An embedded microprocessor will be used to implement a simple chess engine. The chess engine will be able to light up possible movesâ€™ situations. A LED array will be included underneath the board to indicate a variety of information. To prevent illegal moves, the LED where the illegal move was made will blink several times. Different LED colors will be used to differentiate between two players. The AI will also have a unique LED color to indicate that the user is playing against the computer. The LEDs will also be used to indicate where the AI wants to play so that the user can move the chess piece.
